# Manami

## What does it do?
Manami creates an index file for the anime that you already watched and stored on your hard drive. Additionally based on this list the tool can assist you in finding more anime that you might enjoy.

## All features at a glance

* Import list from previous manami releases
* Categorize anime in watched, plan to watch/watching, ignore
* Automatically fill out anime data upon adding a new entry
  * supports multiple meta data providers using data from [anime-offline-database](https://github.com/manami-project/anime-offline-database)
* Find anime by tags
* Browse anime seasons
* Related anime finder
* Suggestions to ignore anime
* No need to provide username or password
* No installer, it's portable

## What it doesn't do
* The tool won't let you update your profile on sites like myanimelist.net, kistu.io,...

## Why?
* I created this tool for my personal needs to support my workflow.

## Installation
* Requires Java 14 or 15
* Download the *.jar file of the latest release
* No installation or additional setup needed. Just Download the `*.jar` and start it by double click or via console `java -jar manami.jar
